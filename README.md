# Netflix Movie Recommendation System

## Introduction
This repository contains the code and data for a Netflix Movie Recommendation System. The recommendation system is based on the collaborative filtering approach using cosine similarity. The data used for this project has been collected from Kaggle.

## Data Source
The dataset used for this project is sourced from Kaggle, a platform for predictive modeling and analytics competitions. The dataset includes information about movies, user ratings, and other relevant features.

## Algorithms Used
The recommendation system employs the cosine similarity algorithm, a popular method in collaborative filtering. Cosine similarity measures the cosine of the angle between two non-zero vectors and is widely used for calculating similarity between users or items.
